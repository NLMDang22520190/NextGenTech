[Provide the brief information of the project: project name, project code, group name, etc.]
1.2 Project Team
[List out the details of the project team and stakeholders…]
2. Product Background
[This section summarizes the rationale for the new product. Provide a general description of the history or situation that leads to the recognition that this product should be built. You should also mention here the information on the customer /the people who raise project idea/request]
3. Existing Systems
[Add the system which might help solving the problems you listed above or the systems in which you can learn/refer the features for your system design]
4. Business Opportunity
[Describe the market opportunity that exists or the business problem that is being solved. Describe the market in which a commercial product will be competing or the environment in which an information system will be used. This may include a brief comparative evaluation of existing products and potential solutions, indicating why the proposed product is attractive. Identify the problems that cannot currently be solved without the product, and how the product fits in with market trends or corporate strategic directions]
5. Software Product Vision
[Write a concise vision statement that summarizes the purpose and intent of the new product and describes what the world will be like when it includes the product. The vision statement should reflect a balanced view that will satisfy the needs of diverse customers as well as those of the developing organization. It may be somewhat idealistic, but it should be grounded in the realities of existing or anticipated customer markets, enterprise architectures, organizational strategic directions, and cost and resource limitations]
6. Project Scope & Limitations
[The project scope defines the concept and range of the proposed solution. It’s also important to define what will not be included in the product. Clarifying the scope and limitations helps to establish realistic expectations of the many stakeholders. It also provides a reference frame against which proposed features and requirements changes can be evaluated. Proposed requirements that are out of scope for the envisioned product must be rejected, unless they are so beneficial that the scope should be enlarged to accommodate them (with accompanying changes in budget, schedule, and/or resources)]
