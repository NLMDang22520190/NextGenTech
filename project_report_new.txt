I. Project Introduction
1. Overview
1.1 Project Information
Project Name: NextGenTech E-commerce Platform
Project Code: SE109
Group Name: NextGenTech Web
Website: https://nexttgentech.netlify.app/

The NextGenTech E-commerce Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to provide a modern shopping experience for technology products. The platform includes both customer-facing features and administrative capabilities for managing the e-commerce operations.

1.2 Project Team
Our project team consists of five members with the following roles:
- Nguyen Van A (SE123456): Team Leader, Backend Developer
- Tran Thi B (SE123457): Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer
- Le Van C (SE123458): Backend Developer, Database Administrator
- Pham Thi D (SE123459): Frontend Developer, Quality Assurance
- Hoang Van E (SE123460): Full-stack Developer, DevOps

2. Product Background
The NextGenTech E-commerce Platform was conceived in response to the growing demand for specialized online marketplaces for technology products. Traditional e-commerce platforms often lack features specifically tailored for tech enthusiasts and professionals who require detailed product specifications and comparisons. The project aims to address this gap by creating a dedicated platform for technology products with enhanced features for product discovery, comparison, and purchasing.

3. Existing Systems
Several e-commerce platforms currently serve the technology market, including:
- Amazon: A general e-commerce platform with a technology section
- Newegg: Specialized in computer hardware and electronics
- Best Buy: Retail chain with an online presence for electronics
- Lazada/Shopee: Popular e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia

While these platforms offer a wide range of products, they often lack specialized features for technology enthusiasts, such as detailed technical specifications, compatibility information, and expert reviews.

4. Business Opportunity
The global consumer electronics market is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 8% from 2021 to 2026. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online shopping, with e-commerce sales of electronics increasing by 30% in 2020 alone.

In Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the digital economy is growing rapidly, with e-commerce being one of the key drivers. The region's internet economy is expected to reach $300 billion by 2025, with e-commerce accounting for a significant portion.

NextGenTech aims to capture a share of this growing market by offering a specialized platform that caters to the needs of technology enthusiasts and professionals.

5. Software Product Vision
NextGenTech will be the premier destination for technology enthusiasts and professionals to discover, compare, and purchase high-quality tech products. Our platform will provide a seamless shopping experience with detailed product information, expert reviews, and personalized recommendations.

For customers, we will offer a user-friendly interface, secure payment options, and efficient order fulfillment. For administrators, we will provide comprehensive tools for managing products, orders, customers, and promotions.

By focusing on the specific needs of technology consumers, NextGenTech will differentiate itself from general e-commerce platforms and establish a loyal customer base of tech-savvy shoppers.
